      <h2>Sun</h2>
      <p>
        The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma,[18][19]
        heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light,
        ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.
        Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about
        330,000 times that of Earth; it accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.[20] Roughly
        three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much
        smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron.[21]
      </p>

      <p>
        The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral class. As such, it is informally and not
        completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is closer to white than yellow). It formed
        approximately 4.6 billion[a][14][22] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a
        large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting
        disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear
        fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.

    <section id="mercury">
      <h2>Mercury</h2>
      <p>
        Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes
        87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury),
        god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god
        Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent
        distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can
        only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight.
        At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus.
        From Earth, the planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon,
        which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2
        spin–orbit resonance,[17] meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times
        for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.[a][18] As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that
        rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer on
        Mercury would therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.

    <section id="venus">
      <h2>Venus</h2>
      <p>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the
        brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare
        occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.[17][18] Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never
        appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a little
        while before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.[19] It has a synodic day length of 117 Earth
        days and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. As a consequence, it takes longer to rotate about its
        axis than any other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus. This
        means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.[20] Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it shares
        only with Mercury among the planets in the Solar System.[21]
      </p>

      <p>
        As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as long as
        records have existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for
        writers and poets as the "morning star" and "evening star". Venus was the first planet to have its motions
        plotted across the sky, as early as the second millennium BC.[26]

    <section id="earth">
      <h2>Earth</h2>
      <p>
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor and support life. About
        29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with
        water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other
        freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's
        outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of
        years, while its interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates
        Earth's magnetic field, and a convective mantle that drives plate tectonics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by tropical regions
        than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Greenhouse gases also play an
        important role in regulating the surface temperature. A region's climate is not only determined by latitude, but
        also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans, among other factors. Severe weather, such as tropical
        cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.

    <section id="mars">
      <h2>Mars</h2>
      <p>
        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than
        only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red
        Planet".[16][17] The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a
        reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.[18] Mars is a terrestrial
        planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the
        valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are investigations assessing the past habitability of Mars, as well as the possibility of extant life.
        Astrobiology missions are planned, such as the European Space Agency's Rosalind Franklin rover.[38][39][40][41]
        Liquid water on the surface of Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the
        atmospheric pressure on Earth, except at the lowest elevations for short periods.[42][43][44] The two polar ice
        caps appear to be made largely of water.[45][46] The volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted,
        would be sufficient to cover the planetary surface to a depth of 11 metres (36 ft).[47] In November 2016, NASA
        reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region. The volume of water detected
        has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior.[48][49][50]

    <section id="jupiter">
      <h2>Jupiter</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more
        than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than
        one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after
        the Moon and Venus. It has been observed since pre-historic times and is named after the Roman god Jupiter, the
        king of the gods, because of its observed size.
      </p>

      <p>
        Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter's magnetic tail is
        nearly 800 million km long, covering the entire distance to Saturn's orbit. Jupiter has 80 known moons and
        possibly many more,[6] including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede,
        the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.
