      <h2>Earth</h2>
      <p>
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor and support life. About
        29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with
        water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other
        freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's
        outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of
        years, while its interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates
        Earth's magnetic field, and a convective mantle that drives plate tectonics.

      <p>
        Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by tropical regions
        than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Greenhouse gases also play an
        important role in regulating the surface temperature. A region's climate is not only determined by latitude, but
        also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans, among other factors. Severe weather, such as tropical
        cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.
